## SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Analytics

Lesson 7 focuses on social tags, SEO, and analytics tools to enhance website visibility and user engagement. Social tags, like Facebook and Twitter share buttons, simplify content sharing on social media, while meta tags control how links appear. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) involves using strategies like single H1 tags, quality backlinks, and avoiding hidden text to improve search engine rankings and drive organic traffic. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) help measure the effectiveness of your website, guiding development choices based on user behavior.

Utilizing tools like Google Analytics provides insights into user interactions, and heat maps can visualize engagement with content. For further learning, resources like Moz and insights from Rand Fishkin can deepen your understanding of SEO best practices. Overall, effectively combining these elements can significantly boost your websiteâ€™s reach and success.
